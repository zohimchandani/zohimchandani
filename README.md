- 👋 Hi, I’m @zohimchandani
- 👀 I’m broadly interested in variational quantum algorithms and its applications. I also dabble with the fundamentals of quantum theory. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computational techniques to improve my programming abilities 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on generative modelling in the classical and quantum regime and quantum computation and its applications. 
- 📫 You can reach me via email on zohim.chandani@hotmail.co.uk
